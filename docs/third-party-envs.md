## <a name="AWSAMI"></a>Generating a Malcolm Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Use on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This section outlines the process of using [packer](https://www.packer.io/)'s [Amazon AMI Builder](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon) to create an [EBS-backed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon/ebs) Malcolm AMI. This section assumes you have good working knowledge of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html).

### <a name="AWSAMIPrerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

* [packer](https://www.packer.io/)
    - the packer command-line tool ([download](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads))
* [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
    - the AWS Command Line Interface with functioning access to your AWS infrastructure
* AWS access key ID and secret access key
    - [AWS security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html)
* ensure the AWS account you are using for packer has minimal required permissions
    - [Amazon AMI builder](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon)

The files referenced in this section can be found in [scripts/third-party-environments/aws/ami]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/scripts/third-party-environments/aws/ami).

1. Copy `packer_vars.json.example` to `packer_vars.json`
    ```bash
    $ cp ./packer_vars.json.example ./packer_vars.json
    ```
1. Edit `packer_vars.json` 
    * set `aws_access_key`, `aws_secret_key`, `vpc_region`, and other variables as needed
1. Validate the packer configuration
    ```bash
    $ packer validate packer_build.json
    The configuration is valid.
    ```
1. Launch packer to build the AMI
    ```bash
    $ packer build -var-file=packer_vars.json packer_build.json

    amazon-ebs: output will be in this color.

    ==> amazon-ebs: Prevalidating any provided VPC information
    ==> amazon-ebs: Prevalidating AMI Name: malcolm-amzn2_v1-2023-05-30T21-12-22Z
        amazon-ebs: Found Image ID: ami-0bef6cc322bfff646

    ...

    ==> amazon-ebs: Waiting for AMI to become ready...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Skipping Enable AMI deprecation...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Terminating the source AWS instance...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Cleaning up any extra volumes...
    ==> amazon-ebs: No volumes to clean up, skipping
    ==> amazon-ebs: Deleting temporary keypair...
    Build 'amazon-ebs' finished after 3 minutes 47 seconds.

    ==> Wait completed after 3 minutes 47 seconds

    ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
    --> amazon-ebs: AMIs were created:
    us-east-1: ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
1. Use `aws` (or the [Amazon EC2 console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home)) to verify that the new AMI exists
    ```bash
    $ aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs" --filters "Name=name,Values=malcolm-*"
    ```
    ```json
    {
        "Images": [

                        }

                "VirtualizationType": "hvm"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
1. Launch an instance from the new AMI
    * `c4.4xlarge`, `t2.2xlarge`, and `t3a.2xlarge` seem to be good instance types for Malcolm
1. SSH into the instance
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/configure` to configure Malcolm
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/auth_setup` to set up authentication for Malcolm
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/start` to start Malcolm
